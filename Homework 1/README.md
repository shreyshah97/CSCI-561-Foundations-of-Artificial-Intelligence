| First line   | Instruction of which algorithm to use, as a string: BFS, UCS or A\*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Second line  | Two strictly positive 32-bit integers separated by one space character, for "W H" the number of columns (width) and rows (height), in cells, of the map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Third line   | Two positive 32-bit integers separated by one space character, for "X Y" the coordinates (in cells) of the starting position for our skier. 0 <= X <= W-1 and 0 <= Y <= H-1 (that is, we use 0-based indexing into the map; X increases when moving East and Y increases when moving South; (0,0) is the North West corner of the map). Starting point remains the same for each of the N lodge sites below and will never contain a tree.                                                           |
| Fourth line  | Positive 32-bit integer number for the stamina S of the skier which determines how advanced our skier is. S will be used to compute allowed moves if weâ€™re moving into a non-tree cell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| fifth line   | Strictly positive 32-bit integer N, the number of lodges on the mountain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Next N lines | Two positive 32-bit integers separated by one space character, for "X Y" the coordinates (in cells) of each lodge site. 0 <= X <= W-1 and 0 <= Y <= H-1 (that is, we again use 0-based indexing into the map). These N target lodge sites are not related to each other, so you will run your search algorithm on each lodge site and write the result to the output as specified below. We will never give you a lodge site that is the same as the starting point. They will never contain a tree. |
| Next H lines | W 32-bit integer numbers separated by any numbers of spaces for the M values of each of the W cells in each row of the map. Each number can represent the following cases: 1. E >= 0, snowy mountain slope with elevation E 2. E < 0, tree of height \|E\| that might be covered with snow depending on the elevation we approach it from                                                                                                                                                            |
